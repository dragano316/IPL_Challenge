## Front End Engineer Challenge – Indian Premier League

**Problem Statement**
Vipul is a big fan of cricket but lately has lost all his interest in the game because of all the entertainment/noise surrounding it. He has never followed the IPL, but this year he's contemplating whether to follow the tournament or not. He has been reading interesting trivia about the IPL, but he hasn't found anything interesting yet.

Use the IPL data given below to create a web app (a dashboard using data visualizations/graphs) with interesting, out-of-the-box stats or trivia to get Vipul interested in the IPL.

Remember that Vipul doesn’t have much time, so create a very easy-to-understand dashboard for him.


## Libraries/Framework used to build the website

    => React.js https://reactjs.org/ - React is an open-source, front end, JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. I used React.js because I am familiar with working in ReactJS.

    => Chart.js https://www.chartjs.org/ - Chart.js is a free open-source JavaScript library for data visualization, which supports 8 chart types: bar, line, area, pie (doughnut), bubble, radar, polar, and scatter. I used it because it is easy to implement and graphs are mobile responsive.
